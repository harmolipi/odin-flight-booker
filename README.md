# Flight Booker
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/odin-flight-booker).

### Functionality

This is the [Flight Booker Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/flight-booker) project, where I m creating more advanced forms by building a typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight.

### Thoughts

Tbd...

God bless.
